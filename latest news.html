               <p>One of the Senate candidates in the district, Usenobong Akpabio, a former state legislator, refused to participate in the primaries due to the court order against Akwa Ibom’s PDP.

                Emmanuel Enoidem, former PDP national legal adviser, won the PDP primaries in northwest Akwa Ibom.
                
                The PDP in Akwa Ibom conducted its primary elections in violation of a Federal High Court order ordering the parties to the lawsuit challenging the PDP’s election of ad-hoc delegates in the state to “maintain the status quo prior to war” pending the hearing and determination of the case.

        <p class="berry">On 11 January 1954, the first in-vision weather forecast was broadcast, presented by George Cowling. In an in-vision the narrator stands in front of the map. At that point, the maps were drawn by hand in the London Weather Centre, before being couriered across London.[4][5] The forecasts were presented by the same person who had composed them, and had relatively low accuracy. The London Weather Centre which opened in 1959 took the responsibility for the national radio weather broadcasts. Radio forecasters were chosen by a BBC audition from the forecasters at the London Weather Centre.[5][6]

            In 1962, the installation of a fax machine and an electronic computer in the Met Office led to more accurate and quicker forecasting.
            
            Satellite photography was available from 1964, but was of a poor quality and was given on paper, with the coastline etched in felt-tip pen. This did not change until 1973 with the installation of a new computer, increasing processing power of the Weather Centre greatly, leading to forecasts twice as accurate as earlier ones.
